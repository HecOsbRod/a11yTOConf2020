- Real captions is not affordable in some cases
- A way to change that is using Real-Time captioning application
- Example [UD Talk](https://udtalk.jp/en/), provides 150 languages
- Japanese live translation is difficult / expensive because Japanese has 3 types of Characters
- Most screen readers will read wrong words (instead of Makoto - they will read Shin)
- Real time captioning can be seeing in your phone
- You can go back to the captions on real time, if you missed something, you can go back and review the notes.
