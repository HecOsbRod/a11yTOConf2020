Yes programmers you also design your code with assumptions.

Our life experiences inform our design assumptions.  
Your biases will influence your designs and approach to accessibility.

Tech is rapidly taking over lives  
We refuse to wait for a11y to be considered when there's time, points or budget  

## How to learn:
- Work alongside the disabled community
    - Hire disabled people
    - Test your product with disabled people
	- Talk to disabled groups

- Demand change where it maters. We have the power to create or destroy barriers. Demand that disabled people have a voice

## What is activism in the digital world?
- We have lost of civil lawsuits
- We're doing structured negotiations
- Our government is sorta, helpful
