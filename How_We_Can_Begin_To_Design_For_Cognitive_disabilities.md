## What's cognitive disability?
- It's a term used to group a large group of disabilities.

## Terms
- Neurotypical: describe individuals of typical developmental, intellectual, and cognitive abilitie
- Neurodivergent: ADHD, Asperger, Alzheimer, Medication usage, brain fog


## Cognitive disability
- It's the most common disability
- It's often overlooked
- 1 Billion people on the world, deal with this disability


## Current State of WCAG
- What is simple language?
- What is simple layout?
- Guidelines are typically Level AAA

## What do to today?
- Language
    - Use Descriptive Page Tiles Define what's on the page. Sets the stage
    - What's a page title? <title>. Developer's responsible for. Designers / Authors should be aware for.
    - Use Page Title - Website name. Example: <title>Page title - Website name</title>
    - Define what you mean when it's not possible to keep things simple. 
        - Use tooltips
        - Add definition or more description text.
        - Add access to the definition of the terms.
- Cognitive Load
    - how much memory should a user have to use a page.
    - Do not require users to remember information
        - Example: use placeholder text on input fields instead of labels (Facebook login page)
        - As the forms become larger, this requires users to remember more information
    - Add hints to indicate what fields are required
    - Add hints to indicate password rules
- Give users access to Copy & Paste
    - Typically not kept in mind when testing products
    - Allow autocomplete
    - Requires less memorization
- Don't force users to do unnecessary tasks
    - Example: ask users to use double security checks (user needs to jump to another app or email)
    - Allow users to copy / paste
    - Disclose what's going to happen before hand
- Avoid Infinite Scroll
    - Encourage users to keep scrolling, it's adictive
    - Instead, include pagination, include load more button
- Avoid page refresh
- Use common patterns & existing mental models
    - For example use the typical video player, instead of reinventing the wheel
- Use accessibility videos & images
    - don't autoplay
    - close captions
    - allow forward & rewind
    - include alt text
- Label your icons
    - Some designers believe they shouldn't do this
    - it doesn't hurt your users
    - consider more than just the aesthetics
- Layouts
    - use whitespace liberally 
        - Means: use it as a tool
        - Use it to draw attention to certain spaces on the page
        - Use it to group content
        - Use it to separate content
    - divide complex tasks into shorter, easier steps
        - use progressive disclousure
    - Example: https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/
- Testing
    - with a variety of users
    - consider to test with neurodivergent users
- Hire people with neurodivergency
