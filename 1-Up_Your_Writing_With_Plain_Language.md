# Play Language to improve accessibility
- what makes some writing more complicated?
    - Sentence Length
    - Syllables

## Sentence Length
- Keep sentences short if material is complicated (between 20 / 25 words average)
- Add variety ( 35 sentences & some with 3 word sentences)


## Syllables
- Syllables are building blocks of words
- Sometimes long words might be unavoidable
- Accessibility has 6 syllables

## How to cut Syllables
- PlanLanguage.gov has some examples: [http://bit.ly/plainwords](http://bit.ly/plainwords)
- Example:
    - prior to -> before
        - 3 syllables -> 2 syllables
        - I proofread the report prior to the meeting
        - I proofread the report before the meeting
    - in order to -> to
        - 4 syllables -> 1 syllables
        - Enable grayscale mode in order to see the page
        - Enable gray scale to see page without colours
    - accordingly / consequently -> so
    - the following -> this
    - however -> but

## Contractions
- do not -> don't
- cannot -> can't
- Contractions improve readability

## How to check your writing
