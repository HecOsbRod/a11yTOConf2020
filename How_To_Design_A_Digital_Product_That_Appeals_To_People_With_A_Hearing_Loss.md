- Create different user personas, it shouldn't replace testing with real users
- Factors in User Persona:
    -  When did they acquired the hearing loss
    - Hearing Loss in dB
    - Communication preferences

- Hearing loss when adult
    - There are 4 million Canadians with some form of hearing loss
    - You might notice that these users don't engage in the same way: up the volume, or people around them need to do extra work to interact with them.
- Hearing loss when teenager: 
    - Will most likely have a listening tool
    - Assumptions: those using a listening tool is a one fix all, but it's not true, they Need other tools: like close captioning, non verbal cues.
    - Listening Fatigue: trying to concentrate too long might force users to tune out after an amount of time
- Hearing loss at birth:
    - Using ASL
    - Remember ASL requires 2 hands to engage and communicate
    - Provide Visual context in front of them
