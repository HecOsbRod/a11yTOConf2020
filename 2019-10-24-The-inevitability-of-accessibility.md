# The inevitability of accessibility 

## 5 Steps of Depression

### Denial:
- Shock
- Paralysis
- How did we get here?
    - Why is this so painful?
    - Where do I find help?

### Anger
- Defensiveness
- Entitlement
- Underneath anger is pain shame, embarrassment and/or fear


### Bargaining
- What's the least we can do?
- Can we use an overlay to fix this? Aria label?
- But how many disabled people are there, really?


### Depression (exhaustion)
- You mean there's more work to do?
- User research shows we are not as good as we thought
- How do we make sure this stays accessible forever?

####  Solutions: 
- Find allies
- Alternate between audit and reading about core
- Work on something else for a while
- Talk to real people


### Acceptance
- Shift left (from audits to a11y in design / user stories early on)
- Ship blockers
- Fearlessly talking to users.
