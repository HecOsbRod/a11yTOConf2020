## I believe, you may disagree

Long term motivations for a11y accommodations built of equity alone re not sustainable

I personally believe the path through inclusive design is actually mainstream innovation.

We have to recognize that we created a barrier when creating new controlers.

- Universal Design is the mountain
- Inclusive design is climbing the mountain

## Innovation
It's vital that game designers create contextual remapping.
Tomb Raider, having facilitator (options for difficulty levels)

## Where can this go?

3 principles for Universal Design for Learning (UDL):
- Providing mulptime means of representation
- Prroviding multiple means of engagement
- Providing multiple means of action and expression

Whats the exprience when you are in your home vs watching a video in a bus? (no headphones)

I'm not saying that striving for a11y is bad, I'm saying 

Engage and listen to people (>1), doing exactly what one person says may steer you in the wrong direction.

Collaborate to identy unmet needs, it is not the responsibility of the community to articulate them
