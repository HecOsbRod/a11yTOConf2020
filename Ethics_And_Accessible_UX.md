## General Notes

- If we focus on peak curve in a Bell Graph, we only 
- Design for stress cases
- Design for diverse situations
- Inspiration book: Interaction Design by Sarah Rogers
- Involve people with disabilities in UX research
    - Validate our assumptions
    - Test our claims
- Generative research: help us explore and discover more about a problem space to define a design problem
- Evaluative research: 
- There are many resources: blogs, articles, encouraging to include people with disabilities and diversity in your studies
- Are we doing enough user research with people with disabilities?
- It is difficult to share findings of studies done with people with disabilities
- Unethical research studies: 
    - Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932-1972): exploited and violated human rights of those involved
    - Nazi's studies during WWII
- [The Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/read-the-belmont-report/index.html): Ethical Principles and guidelines for protection of human subjects of research
- Belmont Report - Principle 1: Respect for persons: Treat people as autonomous agents.
- Recorded videos during User Research are valuable to stakeholders and developers alike. Make sure to get permission to use/share.
- Principle 2 - Beneficence: 
    - protect people from harm
    - maximize possible benefits & minimize possible harms
- Think carefully how long do you want participants to interact with a product. Give them breaks/pauses.
- Your participant wellbeing is more important than your desire to obtain data from user research
- If you don't spend time enough on recruitment process you might get bias results
- Seek diversity beyond accessibility needs you're seeking to research
- Challenge your assumptions & Test your claims
