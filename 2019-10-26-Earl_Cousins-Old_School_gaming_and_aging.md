## Introduction
Games are growing up
- Back in the days: you could spent 15min in Arcade Game
- In the 70s Zelda needed a battery to save!
- Elders Scrolls Online: hunders of hours




## Games Growing Up

### Capabilities
As we age, people's capabilities increase... to an extend!

### Complexity
Atari control was one button + joystick, nowadays a PS4 control has a different standard (14 buttons, two joysticks, track pad, mic, ...)


## Changes

### Vision Changes
- As I aged, vision has decreased
- Witcher 3 update patch to increase size
- Fire Emblem game on Switch, has a lot of petitions online to increase the text size

### Hearing Changes
- Simple action sounds vs environmental soundscapes: because we can make everything too real we have increased the amount of souds played. Example: Elder Scroll has 7 volume settings

### Dexterity Changes
- Can't manage controls as good as before

### Reaction Time
- I have less reaction to events now
- Josh Straub and Uncharted  
[Uncharted 4 developers explain why they added accessibility options to the game](https://www.polygon.com/2016/5/19/11716174/uncharted-4-accessibility-options-disabled-gamers)

### Fatigue
- Guitar band games: I can't finish one of the latest micro games because the main mode of the game required me to finish the game in extreme difficulty level.

### Cognitive Load
- If I worked all day, I don't neccesarily want to do a lot of mental gymnastics while playing games
- Puzzles
- Memory Recall
- Distracting

Uncharted 4 has difficulty level settings, for combat, but not for puzzles.

## Take Action
- Provide Options (Spiderman as an example of menu options)
    - Make accessibility options easily discoverable
    - Present them up front
    - Not only for menus!
- Look back
    - Newer isn't always better (for instance controls were simpler, NES)
    - Simplicity
    - Approachability
- Speak out!
    - Call out issues
    - Describe impact
    - Make positive suggestions!
