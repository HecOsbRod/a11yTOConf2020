## Intro
Neurodivergent definition (add photo in phone)  

SPOON THEORY (insert)

For gaming: 
- Left and right: Naw
- Time dilation: You bet!
- Hyper Focus: Difficult
- Sensory Processing Disorder: Mild to Barrier

Keyboard doesn't work for me.
Keyboard mapping is important for people with dexterity, and people with physical disabilities. 

Why I haven't played more games: 
- it's too **boring**
- it's too **overwhelming**

Games create fun
sometimes, **small features** stand between ND players and normal players

## Concept of being bored
I don't ave enough spoons to pay attention to this.
Mismatch of how much **energy** is required to do something compared to the **reward**

This mismatch turns something **fun** to be **tedious**

Reward > Energy = Too **easy**  
Reward < Energy = Too **tedious**

Unless  I'm obsessed with our game, if I get stuck in it, I will abandon it and never come back.

Tomb raider difficulty options is really important for gamers when the are out of spoons.


## Overwhelmed

Many mechanics in a game are there to purposely **disorient** the player.

### Disorient
- Haptic feedback [yes]
- intense music [ yes]
- Rush of information [yes]
- Changes in HUD [no]

I haven't seen a game that allows to configure HUD, when being overwhelmed. 

[Insert Yakuza 0 Dance Minigame photo....]
This player will never be able to play this game because of sensory overload.

Hints are important to have in games, Like walls in Zelda. (same can apply to web)

#### Damage Warnings
- Character vocals
- Tunnel Vision
- Visual Disorient
- Audio Distortion

This can overload users with mental disability.

#### Grab Attention
- Moving icons
- Flashing content
- Sound effects

If neurotypical palyers find it distracting neurodivergent players will experience it as a barrier.

Perfect example of giving options to users:
Way of the Passive Fist

Indication (bar chart) graph vs numbers is a great way to help those with dislexia.

#### On game pause
Lower the game play music
Lower distractions
Keep options minimal

## Conclusion

- Remove the unneccessary and unintentional **barriers** so players can focus on the **puposeful** game ones
- Give your players different **modes** to match their sliding ability scale (like way of the paci fist)
- Keep the **effort** and **reward** equal
- Allow your users to take a **break** to process
- If it **doesn't** have to move it shouldn't (or gives us an option to stop it) (WCAG Pause, Stop, Hide)
- If it bugs someone that is neuro typical it's going to be a barrier for someone that is neurodivergent.
