- Sources of Harm
## Dark Patterns
- Common choices by design, but hurt the users
- Monetary: makes user spend more money than they wanted
- Temporal: quests that you can only play at certain time
- Social: invite your friends
- Psychological: making fun of players, putting a crying puppy
- Solution:
    - Transparency with your players
    - Provide multiple ways to achieve results
    - Check motivations

## Lack of Trigger Warning
- Many players want to be scared, but there are plenty of players that can be triggered by certain events 
- Consequences  
    - Panic Attacks
    - Abuse from partners
    - Violence: from discrimination, unexpected violence
    - Mental health: eating disorders, anxiety
    - Gas Lighting: convincing other that they are crazy
    - Discrimination: race, ....
- Solution:
    - Make it a setting: Offer Choices
    - Option to skip: 

## Historical Trauma
- Asylum trope:
    - Always portrayed as  dark
    - Misrepresentation
    - Discriminatory
    - Typically patients are represented as dangerous, barely human
- Crazy women
    - Example: Harley
    - Hysteria
    - Instability
    - Loss of Control

## Misrepresentation
- People with disabilities are only responsible of 3% violent acts
- People with disabilities are 10X most likely to get assaulted

## Reflective Equilibrium
- Observe your rules
- Evaluate the rules based on current knowledge
- Weigh the importance of those rules
