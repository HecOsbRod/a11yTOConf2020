- Social Anxiety Disorder: self consciousness, fear, fear of being judged
- Some people are confused why need for web accessibility
- Misconception that people with disabilities don't go to the internet
- Actually, Internet is the great Equalizer
- Technology helps everyone just by existing, it's already accessible
- People were solving their own accessibility needs without knowing, this is why accessibility is important
- Talk about small features on their phone, computer that they use that are oriented to accessibility but they don't know
    - Dark mode
    - Siri / Alexa/ Google talk
    - Closed captions
- "You can't force empathy"
- We can understand how companies don't put Accessibility on the forefront, but we know this affects people's enjoyment of life / sustainability
- By having people understand what accessibility really means, they kind put pressure into companies
