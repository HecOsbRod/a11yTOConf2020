Even so, it doesn't violate any WCAG rules.

- WCAG doesn't focus on user experience
- As an experience auditor, I was thinking about a user's path but in an ad hoc way
- Even with the best intentions, this issue slipped through the cracks during design and development

## Task Oriented walkthrough

A person looks at the usability of the product by walking through tasks in the "shoes" of a user and ask questions from that users point of view.

## Steps
- 1. Prepare your personas
- 2. Identify key tasks a user might perform
- 3. Identify the steps a user might take to achieve the tasks
- 4. Perform the walkthrough with different personas and for different tasks
- 5. Address any possible barriers.

## Step 1 Personas
Option 1: use accessibility-specific personas
Option 2: use existing personas but add different abilities

### Persona cards

## Step 2 Key tasks
Example tasks for the supermarket website
- Create account
- Choose delivery method/time

## Step 3 : steps for key tasks
### Buy groceries:
- Add groceries by searching
- Add groceries by browsing
- Add groceries from saved list
- Add groceries from recently bouth

### Add groceries by searching: 
- Enter butter into search and click on search
- Navigate to "flora butter"
- View detailed description
- Add to cart
- Checkout

## Step 4: conduct the walkthrough
	1. Adopt a persona
	2. Choose a task
	3. walk through the steps for that task as if you were the adapted persona
Do this for all tasks with each persona


## Questions to asks?
- Is there an obvious path the user will take to complete the task?
- How easy is it for the user to identify what actions are available an which is the correct one?
- If the correct step is taken, will the user realize and understand that this is progress towards the desired objective?
- Was the user able to complete the tasks? (with ease)





Step 5 Address possible barriers:

What needs to happen to address possible barriers? 
It Depends (TM)
- Design change
- A11y requirements / annotation change
- Content change
- Code change (if in dev or live)
	
Task oriented approach testing
- Task-oriented rather than page-oriented
- Can be done in the early stages of design as well as on exiting websites
- Can identify requirements gaps
- Might be cheaper & faster compared with usability testing

Caution:
 it can be time consuming
