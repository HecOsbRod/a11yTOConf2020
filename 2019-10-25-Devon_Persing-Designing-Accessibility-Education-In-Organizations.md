## Teaching is hard
- What tools do you use to educate?
- Why is it challenging?
    ○ Many roles
    ○ Many learning needs
    ○ Complex material
    ○ Many contexts

## Service 
- What happens when you have a service without a system?
- Bad examples of a11y:
    ○ "Just send us the testing tool and we'll get started!"
    ○ "We're launching next week and we want to make sure everything is compliant"
    ○ "I set up an hour with you to learn about all the a11y convers for this new project we're kicking off next week"
- “It’s very easy to become the service yourself, where you’re a step in someone else’s workflow.” 

## Literacy
- Collaborative learning
- Information literacy: is the set of integrated abilities encompassing the reflective discovery of inormation, the understanding of how infomration is produced and valued, and the use……
    ○ Teaching people Discover resources efficiently
    ○ Evaluate their usefulness (is it useful)
    ○ Understand their context(who wrote it, why, what's their agenda)
    ○ Create new work
    ○ Participate in community of practice 
- Help people find things instead of creating them yourself

## Survival Tips
### Survival Tip #1
Meet the student where they are

### Survival Tip #2
Aim for literacy, not expertise.

#### Systems
- A11y education in a organization is a virus in a resistant organism.
- We divide the education into Roles and difficulty 
- Role ===> Team ===> Organization (wrong)  
  Organization ===> Team ===> Role (recommended)
- Measure energy and literacy instead of difficulty.   
Examples:  
[FIND Examples]
- The goal is to give people just enough info to get started, 

### Survival Tip #3 
Start a campfire to attract friends.  
- Open a slack channel
- Who are the people that always ask information for their team? 
- Helps you identify teams that are struggling.


## Shopify Polaris (Design System)

Sometimes they have formal code reviews  
Sometimes they do it in agile or they meet in person  

#### Issue Template 
Use the following template to report any a11y issue.
- What is wrong?
- Who does this affect? (population)
- How bad is it?
- What are some general solutions?
- What resources can help?

Write more formal specs (a11y specs):
- Color and contrast
- Keyboard support and focus management
- Updates and announcements
- Animations
- Images and media
- Content hierarchy and flow
	
#### Manual Testing
Find in the github repo
Submitting a PR you need to check that you have done A.. B.. or C

#### Design Tools - Plugin for Figma
a11y Focus Orderer
Allows you to identify what order the focus should be, gives responsibility to the designer.



### Survival Tips #5
Leverage existing strengths
- Service Model: different ways to let people access the info
- Literacy is the goal
- Systems of learning: 

### Survival Tips #6 
Start whenever you can  

### Survival Tips #7 
Don't expect progress to be linear
