## Web Performance
When speaking Compression of images think about: loading time, formats & sizes

You can't talk about accessibility without talking about user experience.

> Missing ALT Text on images leads to poor user experience

## Some data, WEB AIM
- 60% of sites, missing alt TEXT
- Tenon.io: issues by affected users, nearly half where vision related
- Top test failures fit in 5 categories, ALT text is among them

## Alarming Data
Everyday 2 billion photos are uploaded to web.  
1.36 Billion photos are missing ALT text


## AUTOMATE ALT TEXT (AAT)
2.2 billion have vision impairment across the world. (roughly 1/4 of the worldwide population)

- We're applying Computer Vision (CV) to add automated ALT TEXT
- Machine learning & artificial intelligence
CV is hard!
- The data set provided to the algorithm is really important. 

IMAGENET (website with 15M images In 22k categories)
