## User with disabilities quotes
How do you feel when a site is not accessible:
- "I get frustrated!"
- "I'll leave the site, but in case of banking websites have no option but to look for help. Makes me feel dependent."
- "I feel excluded. Invisible"


Acknowledge the pain:  
People with disabilities encounter them on a regular basis

- Calendar widgets
- Games (maybe)

No:
- Text inputs
- Combo boxes
- Rich textareas
