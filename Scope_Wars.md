## MVP - Minimum Viable Product
- minimum lean set of features to validate the product
- Not MVP if is not accessible

## What's required to change
- Train practitioners to know how to create solutions
- Bootcamps & Computer programs should teach accessibility
- Organizations should forefront accessibility
- a11y is a Team sport: designers, researches, devs, testers, POs.....
- Foster an a11y culter & an expertise to guide it.
- Hire disables people and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
- Give employees training & feedback
- a11y should be as lucrative as Javascript Excellence
