Is there's one thing to focus on game designing for a11y is increase the font size. 
The insdustry needs to make prgress on this. In the same way the web usability, the game industry nees to move to scalable UI across board.

Lots of companies are inviting people with disabilities to their offices to design & test games.

The info can also flow from developers to gamers. Both these articles were published before the game release
- a11y in Gears 5 (find url)
- Ghost recon breakpoint to launch with extensive a11y features (find url)

Google Play Games added a filter for Blind-Friendly players.

## Events
- BlizzCon: they started getting into a11y for the event itselft like ASL interpreters, and captions for streams and they vae visual inclusion access wich is a dedicated safe area with no photography and filming and they have lightining talks about a11y itself

- A11y of booths, accessible booth for players

- Video: Road Trip: A11y at Events

- Epic has a Fornite event after E3. On screen is a deaf gamer talking about how excited she is to be there. They got her as apart of the team with Ninja.

- EA donated 150 of their employes building AT. 

## Games
- Indy Events are greats for a11y they don't have to fight the corporation backlog.

Both these games were build by same person. So if one developer can do it, can you imagine what multi million dollar games can do?

- Spiderman was one of the first AAA games including a11y this 2019.

GAmes that have include a11y features include: RDR2, Fifa20, division two, Mortal combat 11, Devil May cry... etc

In 2015 Desitiny added just 1 a11y support in their game

## Legislation

- CV AA fist communications and video accessibility act. 
- When ADA came out in the 90s, communication only comprehended "mobile phones"
- If your game has text or voice chat the communications funcionality itself and any information or used to navigate the funcionality must be accessible.
- This new law applies to every company, regardless of their size.
- The only people that can enforce CV AA is the FCC. So if a consumer is facing an issue they need to register as communication proviers with the FCC.


I was skeptical about this, because all that has been done in a11y in game, was done by the people's passion. I was worried that this legislation was going to replace the desire to five people a good experience with resentment of being forced to.

Accessibility is the new normal, is not feasable to be launcing a game in 2019 or 2020 without thinking about #a11y
