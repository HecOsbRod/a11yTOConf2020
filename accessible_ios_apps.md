- For iOS Apps being accessible should be a given by now

## 11 things we can do for iOS apps
0. Start From Zero
    - Keep a11y notes present all times when developing
1. Labelling Correctly
    - 4d -> four d vs four days ago
    - 3h 24m "three h twenty four m" vs "three hours twenty four minutes" 
    - close button
        - "button"
        - "close_icon_@3x"
        - "close button"
        - "close"
        - Voice Over can read "Close Button, Button"
2. Go to Section Two (Headings)
    - Need to specify headings manually on app development
    - Rotor can be configurable
3. Notifications
4. Advanced gestures
    - Custom modals
    - Custom finger gestures
5. Accessibility customization
    - reduce animations
    - reduce transparency
6. Custom Actions
    - you might want to customized actions like reading a tweet, to reduce the amount number of tabs required to move to next element
