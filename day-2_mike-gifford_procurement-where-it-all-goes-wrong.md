# Procurement - Where It All Goes Wrong!

When companies are creating RFPs, currently they usually only add: 
*"Must meet WCAG 2.0"* 

## Why some don't care about a11y?
- Vendors know that they can get away with it.
- Client doesn't know better, don't have the knowledge or are afraid of it.

We need to have people writing RFPs with a11y knowledge.
Vendors should now the best practices.

### How do we try to make sure this is something were committed to?
Here are 10 steps to do so:
* Define and use a11y policy
* Define a11y targets
* Vendor process (what they are doing, how are they meeting criteria, do they have people with disabilities on field)
* Lead by example (provide accessible RFP)
* Make sure your team has internal expertise
* No VPATs
* Contract vs proposal
* 3rd party validation (evaluated by a 3rd party)
* Post-Launch (there will always be issues after launch)
* Monitoring (it should be the same as security, it should be always monitored)

Ask your vendors, and evaluate your vendors website.
